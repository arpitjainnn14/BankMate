# BankMate
This project is a simple yet powerful Bank Account Management System built using Python and pandas. The application allows users to create new accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, and view account balances. All account information is stored in a CSV file, which ensures data persistence

Note: This project is solely created for practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
